You will need to move your `src` directory from Onboarding into this directory!

You'll also want to move the system tests that you wrote for Onboarding into the appropriate directory under `tests`.

2.1 User Needs

Based upon the feedback received from the survey, while there is a need for a recommender system, there is some conflicting feedback on whether this system should help others be matched based on compatibility or diversity, or a mix. There was also varying feedback on how much data should be collected and if certain questions were too personal. Some users believed that data related to technical skills and logistics should just be used, while others weâ€™re excited to be paired with people based on more personal data. There were some worries about data privacy and potential bias.
